## Enforcement Responsibilities

### Maintainers' Role

Community leaders and project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to:
- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct
- Temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful
- Communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate

### Transparency and Fairness

All enforcement actions will be:
- **Fair**: Consistent application of standards regardless of who is involved
- **Transparent**: Clear communication about violations and consequences
- **Proportional**: Responses appropriate to the severity of the violation
- **Documented**: Records kept for accountability and pattern recognition

---

## Reporting Violations

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it as soon as possible:

**Email**: conduct@triva.dev (monitored by project maintainers)
**Direct Contact**: You may also contact individual maintainers directly if you're uncomfortable with the general reporting channel

### What to Include

When reporting, please include:
- Your contact information (so we can follow up)
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
- Description of what happened and when
- Links or screenshots of the behavior (if applicable)

All reports will be handled with discretion. We respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Details will only be shared with those who need to be involved in the resolution.

### No Retaliation

We will not tolerate retaliation against anyone who reports violations in good faith. Retaliation is itself a violation of this Code of Conduct and will be addressed accordingly.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**Example**: Minor rudeness in a comment, unconstructive criticism, or off-topic posts.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**Example**: Repeated minor violations, posting inappropriate content, or continuing behavior after a correction.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**Duration**: Typically 30-90 days, depending on severity.

**Example**: Harassment, aggressive or threatening language, or repeatedly ignoring moderation.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

**Example**: Doxxing, serious harassment, hate speech, or repeated violations after temporary bans.
