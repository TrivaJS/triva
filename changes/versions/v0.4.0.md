Coming in **v0.5.0**, we plan to push for complete completion of our documentation & landing pages. We also plan to review all package vital components, in an effort to reduce redundancies & blouted functions. Once v0.5.0 is released, our plan is to focus on diagnosing and production errors, in preparation for the following release to be our v1 release.
